# MazeSolver-Project
A simple maze solver using depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find a path from a start point to a goal point in a maze.

Description : 
This project provides a simple maze-solving algorithm using depth-first search (DFS). The maze is represented using a 2D array, and the program attempts to find a path from the starting point to the goal using DFS traversal.

Features : 
Maze representation with walls, open paths, and a goal.
Depth-first search algorithm to find a path through the maze.
Visualization of the maze and the solution path using graphics.

Getting Started : 
Follow these steps to set up and run the maze solver on your local machine.

Prerequisites : 
Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
Java Development Kit (JDK)
Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)

Installation : 
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
Compile and run the MazeSolver class.

Usage : 
Run the MazeSolver class, and the maze visualization window will appear.
The maze will be displayed, and the solution path will be highlighted in green.
